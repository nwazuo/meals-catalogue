# Prdm Meal Catalogue(Catalogue of Meals)

## Tasty and healthy meals powered by frictionless collaboration.

Prdm meal catalogue is a web app for browsing through tasty and healthy meals. You can browse through our catalogue of meals, filter them by category and choose to see only meals from a certain area (e.g. if you want to see only Indian meals 🙂, we got ya with our filters✌).

Click on any meal to view more details, including ingredients, preparation instructions, etc.
